### Hi there 👋

Passionate about game development, driven by open source. I like to work on ambitious and difficult projects to always leave my comfort zone and be confronted with difficulty and therefore push to learn more and more. 

🌱 I’m currently learning rustlang ❤️

🔭 I’m currently working on a Ninja game 😄
